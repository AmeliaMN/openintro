Description: Supplemental functions and data for 'OpenIntro' resources, which 
    includes open-source textbooks and resources for introductory statistics at 
    openintro.org. The package contains data sets used in our open-source textbooks 
    along with custom plotting functions for reproducing book figures. Note that 
    many functions and examples include color transparency; some plotting elements 
    may not show up properly (or at all) when run in some versions of Windows 
    operating system.
